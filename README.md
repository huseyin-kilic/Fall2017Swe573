**Issue Management**

[Issue Repository](https://github.com/huseyin-kilic/Fall2017Swe573/issues) is used for tracking and monitoring research and development tasks, new features, enhancements and bug fixes. Labels have been created for classifying and filtering issues:
* research: investigation on both functional area (domain knowledge, user stories, public APIs) and technical area (languages, frameworks and tools to be used)  
* documentation: creation of requirement analysis document, project planning document, design diagrams and UI mock-ups
* requirement: elitication and documentation and validation of user needs
* design: transformation of user requirements into an accurate level of abstraction which will be used during the implementation phase
* backend: low level design and implementation tasks on server side of the application
* frontend: creation of the user interface module using the mock-ups and corresponding backend services
* test: unit, component and e2e testing tasks
* bug: issues created for tracking self detected & reported malfunctionings
* help-wanted: tasks for which consultancy of a stakeholder is needed
